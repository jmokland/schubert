schubert is a Maple package for Intersection Theory developed by 
Sheldon Katz (katz@math.uiuc.edu) and Stein Arild Stromme
(stromme@math.uib.no).  The current version uses the
package SF developed by John Stembridge.  All files necessary to
run schubert within maple are contained in this directory.  Please
note the following notice:

INSTALLATION

The file schubert.zip contains the "schubertlib"
directory. Entering

 HomeLib := `C:\\Users\\Chasles\\schubertlib`:
 libname := libname, HomeLib:

makes maple aware of the schubert and SF packages. To save you from
entering these two lines every time, you can put the two lines in your 
initialization file, see ?worksheet,reference,initialization for details.

Now schubert should be available through 'with()'.

 with(SF): with(schubert);

REBUILDING

If the files created under Windows XP do not work for you, try and
rebuild. First remove the schubert.m, schubert/*.m, maple.hdb and 
SF.m files and the SF directory. As above tell maple about the 
schubertlib directory

 HomeLib := `C:\\Users\\Chasles\\schubertlib`:
 libname := libname, HomeLib:

then enter 

 read "C:\\Users\\Chasles\\schubertlib\\schubert\\src\\schubert";

which recreates the schubert package. 

Extract John Stembridge's SF2 from http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~jrs/software/SF2.4.tar.gz 
so that SF is in the schubertlib directory. Ignore the COMPILE.SF file and build from inside maple by issuing the commands:

 files := [Par, add_basis, char2sf, conjugate, dominate, dual_basis, evalsf, hooks, itensor, jt_matrix, nextPar, omega, plethysm, scalar, sf2char, skew, stdeg, subPar, theta, toe, toh, top, tos, varset, zee, SF, added, dualize, homog_cmps, jt_det, to_ehp, tools, verify];

 for file in files do parse(cat(`read `, cat("`C:\\\\Users\\\\Chasles\\\\schubertlib\\\\SF\\\\src\\\\", file, "`;")), statement) end do;

At this point schubert and SF will respond to 'with()', but the newly created helpfiles are unavailable. Restarting maple and pointing it to schubertlib again will make them available.

Enjoy!
